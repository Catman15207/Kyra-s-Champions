     <h2>Kyra’s Champions focuses on legislative initiatives on the federal and state levels to ensure children and their safety are top priorities in our family court systems.</h2>

<p><a href="#">CLICK HERE TO SUPPORT KYRA'S LAW TODAY</a></p>

<p>Our mission is to stop child abuse and child murders. We advocate for policy changes that promote and protect children and families at risk of family violence. We need your help and support to ensure our voices are heard and that laws are passed to protect at-risk children.</p>

<p>As a 501(c)4 charity, we seek to change the way issues of violence and abuse are addressed in family courts so that child safety is put above all else.</p>

<p>Kyra’s Champions was founded by Jacqueline Franchetti in memory of her sweet, vibrant, loving 2-year-old daughter, Kyra, who was shot to death while sleeping by her father, who then set his house on fire and killed himself during an unsupervised, court-ordered visit.</p>

<h3>Kyra’s story is not unique.</h3>
<ul>
  <li>70% FAILURE RATE in which family court are convinced by an abuser that the victimized parent should be denied sole custody</li>
  <li>58,000 AT-RISK CHILDREN are ordered into unsupervised visitation with an abusive parent by state family courts each year</li>
  <li>75% OF CHILD DEATHS in the United States are at the hands of a parent</li>
  <li>Over 1/2 million children today are court-ordered into a home where they are being sexually, physically, or emotionally abused</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>We honor Kyra’s memory by working to ensure no other child should have the same fate as Kyra and no other family should be impacted by a similar tragedy.</strong></p>
