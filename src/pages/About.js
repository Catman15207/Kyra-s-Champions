        Our mission is to protect children in custody cases from being
        court-ordered into the home of an abusive parent.
      </h1>

      <p>
        Kyra’s Champions is a 501(c)4 charity advocating for policy and
        legislative changes that promote and protect children at risk
        of family violence.
      </p>

      <p>
        We raise awareness about the dangers to children, inside and
        outside our divorce/family court system, and seek changes in
        the way family violence and child abuse are addressed in child
        custody cases.
      </p>

      <p>
        Kyra’s Champions was founded by Jacqueline Franchetti in memory
        of her sweet, vibrant, loving 28-month-old daughter Kyra, who,
        in July 2016 during a court-sanctioned unsupervised visit, was
        shot twice in the back while she slept by her father, who then
        set his house on fire and killed himself.

        <strong>
          Kyra’s Champions focuses on legislative initiatives on the
          federal and state levels to ensure children and their safety
          are top priorities in our family court systems.
